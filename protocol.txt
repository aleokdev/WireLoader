WIRELOADER PROTOCOL
port: 3200
ops:
  retrieve
    client -> server
    servers must return a message containing a `prg` payload.
  prg <uid> <name> <latest version> <size> <author>
    server -> client
    contains basic information about a program.
    sent when clients broadcast `retrieve`, used for displaying the program list.
    if the server has no binaries for the program, the version is set to be
    "_NOBIN".
  prgdesc <uid>
    client -> server
    Requests the server to return a `prgdesc` op containing a program's
    description.
  prgdesc <uid> <description>
    server -> client
    Contains the description for a program. Sent when a client sends an
    appropiate `prgdesc` op.
  prgvers <uid>
    client -> server
    Requests the server to send all `prgver` ops available for a program.
  prgver <uid> <name> <size>
    server -> client
    Contains information about a specific program version.
  prgdl <uid> <version>
    client -> server
    Requests a program binary. Server will respond with a bunch of `prgdata`
    packets.
  prgfile <uid> <path>
    server -> client
    Orders the client to create a file at the path given to accomodate all the
    `prgdata` packets that come next.
  prgdata <uid> <binary data>
    server -> client
    Communicates a certain file data to the client. Must be done after `prgfile`
    The data will be placed at the end of the last file communicated via
    `prgfile`.
  prgdend <uid>
    server -> client
    Establishes the end of a prgfile-prgdata sequence. If this is sent, it means
    that the program has been fully sent.
